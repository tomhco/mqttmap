Congratulations, you’ve got something with the best licence ever.
Basically, you’re free to do what you want with it; as long as you do something good (help someone out, smile; just be nice), you can use this on anything you fancy.
Of course, if it all breaks, it’s totally not the author’s fault.
Enjoy!
